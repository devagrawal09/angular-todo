# Angular Todo App

This repository contains the app I created to practice my hand at Angular 2+.

## About the app

This is a simple CRUD app based on [todomvc](http://todomvc.com) using Angular 2 and is built using Angular CLI.

## Running locally

Make sure you have the latest version of Angular CLI installed. If not, install it using `npm install -g @angular/cli`.

Clone the repository and run `npm install` in the root directory.

The app uses [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) for a mock REST backend. To run the mock backend, run `npm run json-server` in the root application directory.

In a seperate terminal window, run `ng serve` in the root application directory, which starts the local development server at `localhost:4200`.
